## 📊 Strategy Logic

### Entry Conditions

2. **Anchor Hedge**: Price hits support level with volume
3. **Opportunity Position**: Price hits second support level
4. **Opportunity Hedge**: Price hits extreme support level

### Exit Conditions

1. **Hedge Exit**: Price recovers above support level
2. **Position Exit**: Take profit at resistance levels
3. **Emergency Exit**: Manual stop or system error

### Risk Management

- **Liquidation Protection**: Automatic liquidation at 10% drop
- **Hedge Protection**: 15x leverage ensures profit even in liquidation
- **Position Limits**: Maximum 4 positions (2 long + 2 hedge)
- **Balance Distribution**: 20% + 30% + 20% + 30% = 100%
- **Guaranteed Profit**: +7% minimum even in worst case scenario
