## [1.2.12] - 2025-09-27

### üéØ ROI-Based Take Profit System

This release introduces a revolutionary ROI-based take profit system that allows positions to exit based on Return on Investment rather than price percentage movements, enabling more frequent trades with consistent 2% returns.

### ‚ú® New Features

#### ROI-Based Take Profit System
- **ROI Calculator Utility**: New `ROICalculator` class for precise ROI calculations and analysis
- **Dual Take Profit Modes**: Support for both ROI-based (`USE_ROI_BASED_TP=true`) and price-based take profit
- **Consistent Profit Targets**: Positions exit at configurable ROI percentages (default: 2% ROI)
- **Enhanced Profit Consistency**: More frequent trades with predictable returns regardless of market conditions

#### Environment Configuration
- **ROI Settings**: Added `USE_ROI_BASED_TP=true` to enable ROI-based take profit
- **ROI Targets**: Added `HF_ROI_TARGET=2.0`, `ANCHOR_ROI_TARGET=2.0`, `OPPORTUNITY_ROI_TARGET=2.0`, `SCALP_ROI_TARGET=2.0`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for price-based take profit as fallback

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### ROI Calculation Engine
- **Precise ROI Calculations**: Calculate current ROI, target prices, and required price movements
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed ROI analysis with logging and monitoring
- **Position Management**: Updated `PositionManager` to support ROI-based take profit setting
- **Strategy Integration**: Enhanced `HighFrequencyStrategy` with ROI-based signal generation

#### Enhanced Logging and Monitoring
- **ROI Analysis Logs**: Detailed logging of ROI calculations and target achievements
- **Signal Generation**: Updated signal generation to show ROI-based targets
- **Position Monitoring**: Enhanced position monitoring with ROI-based exit conditions

### üìä Configuration Examples

#### Conservative Trading (1% ROI)
```bash
USE_ROI_BASED_TP=true
HF_ROI_TARGET=1.0
ANCHOR_ROI_TARGET=1.0
```

#### Aggressive Trading (3% ROI)
```bash
USE_ROI_BASED_TP=true
HF_ROI_TARGET=3.0
ANCHOR_ROI_TARGET=3.0
```

#### Mixed Strategy
```bash
USE_ROI_BASED_TP=true
HF_ROI_TARGET=2.0          # ROI-based for HF
ANCHOR_TP_PERCENT=1.0     # Price-based for Anchor
```

### üéØ Benefits

#### More Frequent Trades
- **Smaller Price Movements**: Required for profit achievement
- **More Opportunities**: In volatile markets
- **Faster Profit Realization**: Reduced waiting time for targets

#### Better Risk Management
- **Consistent Profit Percentages**: Predictable returns for better planning
- **Easier Position Sizing**: Simplified calculations based on ROI targets
- **Leverage Optimization**: Higher leverage = smaller price movements needed

### üìà Impact

- **Trading Frequency**: Increased due to smaller price movements required
- **Profit Consistency**: Improved with predictable ROI-based exits
- **Risk Management**: Enhanced with consistent profit percentages
- **Capital Efficiency**: Optimized through leverage-based ROI calculations
