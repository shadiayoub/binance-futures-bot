# 🚀 Hedged Scalping Strategy

## Overview

The **Hedged Scalping Strategy** is a revolutionary approach to high-frequency trading that combines the speed of scalping with the safety of hedging. This strategy operates on 15-minute intervals within tight price ranges, using a dynamic hedge system that ensures near-zero loss even in adverse market conditions.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

> **"Hedge closes ONLY when its ROI > Scalp ROI"**

This simple rule ensures optimal profit taking while maintaining the scalp position's potential for future gains.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Position Sizing
- **Scalp Position**: 10% of total balance
- **Scalp Hedge**: 10% of total balance
- **Total Risk**: 20% of account balance

### Leverage Settings
- **Scalp Leverage**: 15x
- **Hedge Leverage**: 18x (20% higher than scalp)
- **Hedge Advantage**: 0.81% per 0.27% price movement

## 🔄 Trading Logic

### 1. Entry Conditions
- **Support Level Entry**: Price near learned support levels
- **Volume Confirmation**: Volume above 1.5x average
- **RSI Validation**: RSI between 30-70 (not oversold)
- **Trend Alignment**: 4H trend bullish or sideways

### 2. Hedge Opening
- **S/R Level Based**: Hedge opens at learned support levels
- **No Fixed Pips**: Market structure-based triggers
- **Dynamic Levels**: Adapts to market changes

### 3. Hedge Management
- **ROI-Based Closure**: Hedge closes when ROI > Scalp ROI
- **Independent Closing**: Each hedge level closes independently
- **Scalp Continuation**: Scalp remains open after hedge closure

## 💰 Profit Mechanics

### Scenario 1: Price Moves Up (Scalp Wins)
```
Scalp: +4.05% profit (0.27% × 15x)
Hedge: Never opened
Net Result: +4.05% profit ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Price Drops (Hedge Opens)
```
Scalp: -2.40% loss (0.16% × 15x)
Hedge: +2.88% profit (0.16% × 18x)
Net Result: +0.48% profit ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Hedge ROI > Scalp ROI (Hedge Closes)
```
Scalp: -2.40% loss (continues)
Hedge: +2.88% profit (closed - taken)
Net Result: +2.88% profit ✅
```

### Scenario 4: After Hedge Closes, Price Returns (Scalp Wins)
```
Scalp: -2.40% → +4.05% (net +1.65% profit)
Hedge: Already closed (+2.88% profit)
Total Result: +4.53% profit ✅
```

## 🛡️ Risk Management

### Dynamic Hedge System
- **Multiple Hedge Levels**: Cascading hedge system for extreme moves
- **Independent Management**: Each hedge closes based on its own ROI
- **No Maximum Loss**: Hedge protection ensures near-zero loss
- **Market Structure Based**: Uses learned S/R levels, not fixed pips

### Leverage Advantage
- **Higher Hedge Leverage**: 18x vs 15x scalp leverage
- **Profit Multiplier**: 1.2x advantage for hedge positions
- **Risk Mitigation**: Hedge profit covers scalp loss + additional profit
