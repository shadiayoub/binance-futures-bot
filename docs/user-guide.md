# ADA Futures Trading Bot - User Guide

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+ installed
- pnpm package manager
- Binance account with Futures enabled
- Binance API credentials (with Futures trading permissions)
- **🔧 CRITICAL: Binance account set to HEDGE MODE** (see setup instructions below)

### **Installation**

1. **Clone and Setup**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
pnpm install
```

2. **Configure Environment**
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

3. **Test Configuration**
```bash
pnpm run test:config
```

4. **Build and Run**
```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

## 🔧 **CRITICAL: Binance HEDGE Mode Setup**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The bot requires your Binance account to be set to **HEDGE MODE** to function properly. This is essential for the 4-position hedging strategy.

### **Step-by-Step Setup:**

1. **Log into Binance Futures**
   - Go to [Binance Futures](https://www.binance.com/en/futures)
   - Ensure you're on the Futures trading interface

2. **Access Position Mode Settings**
   - Click on your **profile icon** (top right)
   - Select **"Position Mode"** from the dropdown menu

3. **Change to HEDGE Mode**
   - You'll see two options:
     - ❌ **One-way Mode** (default)
     - ✅ **Hedge Mode** (required)
   - **Select "Hedge Mode"** and confirm the change

4. **Verify the Change**
   - You should see "Hedge Mode" displayed in your interface
   - This allows both LONG and SHORT positions simultaneously

### **Why HEDGE Mode is Required:**
- **4-Position Strategy**: Anchor, Hedge, Opportunity, Opportunity Hedge
- **Bidirectional Trading**: Both LONG and SHORT positions
- **Risk Management**: Independent position management
- **Guaranteed Profit**: Mathematical hedging system

**🚨 Without HEDGE mode, you'll get error: `Order's position side does not match user's setting. {"code":-4061}`**

### **✅ Position Side Parameter Fix (Latest Update)**

The bot now includes the **positionSide parameter** in all order operations to ensure compatibility with Binance Hedge Mode:

#### **What Was Fixed:**
- **✅ Added `positionSide: 'LONG'` or `positionSide: 'SHORT'`** to all order operations
- **✅ Fixed `openPosition` method** with proper positionSide parameter
- **✅ Fixed `closePosition` method** with proper positionSide parameter  
- **✅ Fixed `setTakeProfitOrder` method** with proper positionSide parameter
- **✅ Graceful fallback** if position side mode setting fails

#### **Expected Results:**
```
✅ Position opened successfully: LONG 453 ADA @ 0.8800
✅ Position closed successfully: SHORT 453 ADA @ 0.8768
```

Instead of:
```
❌ Failed to open position Order's position side does not match user's setting.
```

```

## 🎯 **Trading Strategy (Complete Bidirectional System)**

### **🔄 CRITICAL: Sequential Position Management (Latest Update)**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The bot now enforces **sequential position cycles** where only **one position type at a time** can be active. This ensures complete focus on each strategy until its cycle is finished.

#### **Sequential Position Rules:**
- **Only ONE position type** can be active at any time (ANCHOR OR PEAK OR SCALP)
- **Complete cycle required** before new position type can open
- **Cycle completion** means ALL positions of that type are closed (position + hedge)
- **No overlapping strategies** - clean, focused trading approach

#### **Position Cycle Logic:**
- **ANCHOR Cycle**: ANCHOR position + ANCHOR_HEDGE position (both must be closed)
- **PEAK Cycle**: PEAK position + PEAK_HEDGE position (both must be closed)
- **SCALP Cycle**: SCALP position + SCALP_HEDGE position (both must be closed)
- **New cycles** can only start when current cycle is completely finished

#### **Expected Behavior Examples:**

**Scenario 1: ANCHOR Cycle Active**
```
1. ANCHOR (LONG) opens → ANCHOR cycle begins
2. PEAK signal → BLOCKED (ANCHOR cycle still active)
3. SCALP signal → BLOCKED (ANCHOR cycle still active)
4. ANCHOR_HEDGE (SHORT) opens → ANCHOR cycle continues
5. Both positions close → ANCHOR cycle complete
6. New signals → ALLOWED (ready for new cycle)
```

**Scenario 2: PEAK Cycle Active**
```
1. PEAK (LONG) opens → PEAK cycle begins
2. ANCHOR signal → BLOCKED (PEAK cycle still active)
3. SCALP signal → BLOCKED (PEAK cycle still active)
4. PEAK_HEDGE (SHORT) opens → PEAK cycle continues
5. Both positions close → PEAK cycle complete
6. New signals → ALLOWED (ready for new cycle)
```

**Scenario 3: SCALP Cycle Active**
```
1. SCALP (LONG) opens → SCALP cycle begins
2. ANCHOR signal → BLOCKED (SCALP cycle still active)
3. PEAK signal → BLOCKED (SCALP cycle still active)
4. SCALP_HEDGE (SHORT) opens → SCALP cycle continues
5. Both positions close → SCALP cycle complete
6. New signals → ALLOWED (ready for new cycle)
```

### **Precise Trading Logic**

The bot follows this exact sequence with **complete bidirectional capabilities** and **sequential position management**:

#### **1. Anchor Open (Bidirectional)**
- **Bull Market**: Price breaks resistance level with volume confirmation
  - **Action**: Open LONG position (20% × 10x leverage)
  - **Conditions**: RSI 30-70, 4H trend bullish/sideways, volume ≥ 0.1x average
  - **Level System**: Uses comprehensive levels for consistent entry signals
  - **Cycle Check**: Only if no other position type is active
- **Bear Market**: Price breaks support level with volume confirmation
  - **Action**: Open SHORT position (20% × 10x leverage)
  - **Conditions**: RSI 30-70, 4H trend bearish/sideways, volume ≥ 0.1x average
  - **Level System**: Uses comprehensive levels for consistent entry signals
  - **Cycle Check**: Only if no other position type is active

#### **2. Liquidation-Based Hedge Strategy (Revolutionary!)**
- **For LONG Anchor**: Price drops below first support level
  - **Action**: Open SHORT hedge position (30% × 25x leverage)
  - **Purpose**: Guaranteed profit system through liquidation mechanics
- **For SHORT Anchor**: Price rises above first resistance level
  - **Action**: Open LONG hedge position (30% × 25x leverage)
  - **Purpose**: Guaranteed profit system through liquidation mechanics

#### **3. Hedge Take Profit Set Before Liquidation**
- **Automatic**: Hedge TP set 2% before anchor liquidation price
- **LONG Anchor**: `Hedge TP = Anchor Liquidation × 1.02`
- **SHORT Anchor**: `Hedge TP = Anchor Liquidation × 0.98`
- **Result**: Hedge profits BEFORE anchor gets liquidated

#### **4. Three Profit Scenarios (Mathematical Guarantee)**

**Scenario A: Guaranteed Profit (Liquidation)**
- Anchor approaches liquidation → Hedge hits TP first
- Hedge profit > Anchor loss → Net guaranteed profit
- Both positions close for guaranteed profit

**Scenario B: Double Profit (Best Case)**
- Hedge hits TP → Price returns to support
- Hedge closes with profit → Anchor continues to target
- Both positions profit independently

**Scenario C: Safety Exit (Price Returns)**
- Price returns to hedge entry → Hedge closes at break-even
- Anchor continues to target → Normal profit
- No losses, only gains

#### **5. Same for Opportunity and Its Hedge (Bidirectional)**
- **LONG Opportunity**: Opens at second support level, hedged with SHORT
- **SHORT Opportunity**: Opens at second resistance level, hedged with LONG
- **Same Logic**: Take profit at opportunity liquidation, close on return to entry

#### **6. Intelligent Profit-Taking (Complete System!)**
- **Anchor Positions**: Take profit at HIGH/CRITICAL resistance/support levels + peak detection
- **Opportunity Positions**: Take profit at MEDIUM+ resistance/support levels + peak detection
- **Scalp Positions**: Take profit at resistance/support levels + peak detection (BIDIRECTIONAL!)
- **Minimum Profit**: 2% for anchors, 1.5% for opportunities, 0.27% for scalp
- **Technical Confirmation**: RSI overbought/oversold + volume analysis + peak detection
- **Price Tolerance**: 0.5% around levels for practical execution
- **Complete Coverage**: All four position types have peak detection fallback

### **Complete Bidirectional System Overview**

#### **All Strategies Now Bidirectional:**
- **✅ ANCHOR**: LONG and SHORT entries with opposite hedges
- **✅ OPPORTUNITY**: LONG and SHORT entries with opposite hedges  
- **✅ SCALP**: LONG and SHORT entries with opposite hedges (NEW!)

#### **Unified Entry Logic:**
- **LONG Entries**: At support levels (price bounces up)
- **SHORT Entries**: At resistance levels (price bounces down)
- **Volume Confirmation**: ≥ 0.1 ratio (consistent across all strategies)
- **RSI Filter**: 30-70 range (consistent across all strategies)
- **Comprehensive Levels**: Same level system for all strategies

#### **Complete Peak Detection Coverage:**
- **ANCHOR_LONG**: Price peak detection (0.3% threshold)
- **ANCHOR_SHORT**: Price trough detection (0.3% threshold)
- **OPPORTUNITY_LONG**: Price peak detection (0.3% threshold)
- **OPPORTUNITY_SHORT**: Price trough detection (0.3% threshold)
- **SCALP_LONG**: Price peak detection (0.2% threshold)
- **SCALP_SHORT**: Price trough detection (0.2% threshold)

### **Margin Mode: ISOLATED**

- **Critical Setting**: All positions use ISOLATED margin mode

## 🎯 **Bidirectional Peak Strategy (Revolutionary!)**

### **Overview**
The bot now features a **revolutionary Bidirectional Peak Strategy** that transforms the traditional Opportunity strategy into an intelligent market reversal detection system. This strategy **only opens when existing positions are profitable** and uses advanced peak/trough detection to catch market reversals for **double profit potential**.

### **🔧 Important: Code vs Functionality Terminology**

#### **Code Implementation vs User Documentation**
- **Code Variable Names**: Still uses `OPPORTUNITY` type and `shouldOpenOpportunity()` methods
- **Actual Functionality**: Implements the new **Peak Strategy** with revolutionary features
- **Position Type**: `OPPORTUNITY` in code = **Peak Strategy** in behavior
- **Why**: Maintains code compatibility while adding new functionality

#### **What This Means for Users**
- **Logs**: May show "Opportunity" terminology (legacy code)
- **Behavior**: Actually runs the new Peak Strategy features
- **Functionality**: Market reversal detection, profit requirements, peak/trough detection
- **Safety**: Only opens when existing positions are profitable

#### **Code Examples in Logs**
```typescript
// Code still uses old terminology
pos.type === 'OPPORTUNITY'           // = Peak Strategy position
shouldOpenOpportunity()              // = shouldOpenPeakReversal()
shouldTakeProfitOpportunity()        // = Peak profit-taking logic
shouldHedgeOpportunity()             // = Peak hedge protection
```

#### **Actual Functionality**
```typescript
// What it actually does (Peak Strategy)
- Detects market peaks (SHORT entries)
- Detects market troughs (LONG entries)
- Only opens when existing position is profitable
- Uses 5-point pattern recognition
- Has built-in hedge protection
- Revolutionary market reversal detection
```

### **🛡️ Safety-First Design**

#### **Sequential Position Management**
- **🛡️ CRITICAL**: Peak positions **only open when no other position type is active**
- **Complete Focus**: Each strategy gets full attention until cycle completion
- **No Overlapping Risk**: Prevents multiple strategies from conflicting
- **Clean Execution**: One position type at a time for optimal performance

```typescript
// Sequential Rule Implementation
const hasAnyOpenPositions = this.currentPositions.some(pos => pos.status === 'OPEN');
if (hasAnyOpenPositions) {
  logger.info('🚫 Peak Strategy Blocked: Another position cycle is active');
  return false; // Block Peak if any position type is active
}
```

### **🎯 Bidirectional Peak Detection**

#### **Market Peak Detection (SHORT Peak Positions)**
- **Trigger**: When no other position type is active AND market has peaked
- **Pattern**: Price went up → peaked → started declining
- **Confirmation**: RSI overbought (>70) + volume decreasing + 0.3% decline
- **Action**: Open SHORT Peak position to catch the decline

#### **Market Trough Detection (LONG Peak Positions)**
- **Trigger**: When no other position type is active AND market has troughed
- **Pattern**: Price went down → bottomed → started rising
- **Confirmation**: RSI oversold (<30) + volume increasing + 0.3% rise
- **Action**: Open LONG Peak position to catch the rise

### **📊 Advanced Peak/Trough Detection Logic**

#### **5-Point Pattern Recognition**
```typescript
// Peak Pattern: price went up, peaked, then started declining
const isPeak = second.price > first.price && 
               third.price > second.price && 
               fourth.price < third.price && 
               fifth.price < fourth.price;

// Trough Pattern: price went down, bottomed, then started rising
const isTrough = second.price < first.price && 
                 third.price < second.price && 
                 fourth.price > third.price && 
                 fifth.price > fourth.price;
```

#### **Multi-Confirmation System**
- **RSI Confirmation**: Overbought (>70) for peaks, Oversold (<30) for troughs
- **Volume Confirmation**: Decreasing volume for peaks, increasing for troughs
- **Price Movement**: Minimum 0.3% decline/rise from peak/trough
- **Pattern Validation**: 5-point price pattern confirmation

### **🎯 Peak Strategy Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: ANCHOR Cycle → PEAK Cycle**
```
1. ANCHOR (LONG) Entry: 0.8838 → ANCHOR cycle begins
2. ANCHOR_HEDGE (SHORT) opens → ANCHOR cycle continues
3. Both positions close → ANCHOR cycle complete
4. Peak Detected: Market peaked and declining
5. PEAK (SHORT) Entry: 0.8947 → PEAK cycle begins
6. PEAK_HEDGE (LONG) opens → PEAK cycle continues
7. Both positions close → PEAK cycle complete
8. Result: Sequential cycles with focused execution! 🚀
```

#### **Scenario 2: SCALP Cycle → ANCHOR Cycle**
```
1. SCALP (LONG) Entry: 0.8850 → SCALP cycle begins
2. SCALP_HEDGE (SHORT) opens → SCALP cycle continues
3. Both positions close → SCALP cycle complete
4. Resistance Breakout: Market breaks resistance level
5. ANCHOR (LONG) Entry: 0.9000 → ANCHOR cycle begins
6. ANCHOR_HEDGE (SHORT) opens → ANCHOR cycle continues
7. Both positions close → ANCHOR cycle complete
8. Result: Clean sequential execution with no conflicts! 🚀
```

### **🛡️ Built-in Hedge Protection**

#### **Same Safety as Opportunity Strategy**
- **Automatic Hedging**: Peak positions get same hedge protection
- **Liquidation-Based Exits**: Guaranteed profit scenarios still work
- **Double Profit Scenarios**: Both positions can profit independently
- **Safety Exits**: Hedge closes at break-even if reversal fails

#### **Peak Hedge Logic**
```typescript
// For LONG Peak: hedge when price drops below entry (reversal failed)
if (priceBelowEntry && priceDecline >= 1%) {
  // Open SHORT hedge to protect LONG Peak
}

// For SHORT Peak: hedge when price rises above entry (reversal failed)  
if (priceAboveEntry && priceRise >= 1%) {
  // Open LONG hedge to protect SHORT Peak
}
```

```

#### **Position Sizing (Peak Strategy - Uses Opportunity Variables)**
```env
# Note: Code still uses "OPPORTUNITY" variable names for Peak Strategy
OPPORTUNITY_POSITION_SIZE=0.20  # 20% of balance for Peak positions
OPPORTUNITY_HEDGE_SIZE=0.30     # 30% of balance for Peak hedges
OPPORTUNITY_LEVERAGE=10         # 10x leverage for Peak positions

# These variables control the Peak Strategy functionality
# despite using "OPPORTUNITY" in the variable names
```

### **📊 Peak Strategy Logs**

#### **Important: Log Terminology**
- **Log Messages**: May show "Opportunity" terminology (legacy code)
- **Actual Behavior**: Implements Peak Strategy functionality
- **Position Types**: `OPPORTUNITY` in logs = Peak Strategy positions

## 🚀 **High-Frequency Scalping Strategy**

### **Overview**
The bot includes a sophisticated **bidirectional scalping system** that operates on 15-minute intervals within tight price ranges, with a crucial hedging backup system to ensure near-zero loss scenarios. **NEW: Now supports both LONG and SHORT scalp entries!**

### **Scalp Strategy Components (BIDIRECTIONAL!)**

#### **1. Capital Allocation**
- **Scalp Position**: 10% of total balance
- **Scalp Hedge**: 10% of total balance
- **Leverage**: 15x for scalp, 25x for hedge (higher leverage for better protection)

#### **2. Entry Conditions (BIDIRECTIONAL!)**
- **Timeframe**: 15-minute intervals
- **LONG Entries**: At support levels (price bounces up)
- **SHORT Entries**: At resistance levels (price bounces down)
- **Range**: Tight price ranges between learned S/R levels
- **Confirmation**: Volume + RSI + trend alignment
- **Target**: Quick 0.27% profits within the range
- **Comprehensive Levels**: Uses same level system as anchor/opportunity

#### **3. Liquidation-Based Scalp Hedging**
- **Dynamic Hedging**: Hedges open at learned S/R levels (not fixed pips)
- **Higher Leverage**: Hedge uses 25x vs 15x scalp leverage (safety position)
- **Liquidation-Based Closure**: Hedge TP set before scalp liquidation
- **Guaranteed Protection**: Three profit scenarios (guaranteed, double, safety)

#### **4. Multi-Timeframe Learning**
- **4H Data**: 180 days (6 months) for major S/R levels
- **1H Data**: 7 days for medium-term levels  
- **15m Data**: 1 day for precise scalp entry/exit levels
- **Combined Analysis**: All timeframes weighted and combined for comprehensive market view

#### **5. Scalp Trade Lifecycle**

**Phase 1: Entry**
```
Current Price: $0.8850
Scalp Entry: LONG at $0.8850 (10% capital, 15x leverage)
Target: $0.8900 (0.56% profit)
```

**Phase 2: If Price Drops**
```
Price drops to $0.8800 (learned support level)
Hedge Opens: SHORT at $0.8800 (10% capital, 18x leverage)
Scalp: Still open, now losing
Hedge: Protects against further losses
```

**Phase 3: Liquidation-Based Hedge Management**
```
Scenario A: Guaranteed Profit
- Hedge TP hit before scalp liquidation
- Both positions close for net profit
- Mathematical guarantee of profit

Scenario B: Double Profit
- Hedge TP hit → Price returns to scalp entry
- Hedge closes with profit → Scalp continues to target
- Both positions profit independently

Scenario C: Safety Exit
- Price returns to hedge entry
- Hedge closes at break-even
- Scalp continues to target
```

#### **6. Risk Management**
- **Maximum Loss**: Near zero due to hedging system
- **Position Sizing**: Conservative 10% per position
- **Leverage Control**: Higher hedge leverage ensures protection
- **S/R Based**: All decisions based on learned support/resistance levels

## 💰 **Dynamic Balance System (Revolutionary!)**

### **Real-Time Balance Detection and Position Sizing**

The bot now features a **dynamic balance system** that automatically detects your account balance changes and adjusts position sizing in real-time. No more restarts required when you add funds!

#### **How Dynamic Balance Works**

##### **Before (Static System)**
```
Bot starts with $200 balance → All positions use $200 for sizing
You add $800 → Bot still uses $200 → Requires restart
```

##### **After (Dynamic System)**
```
Bot starts with $200 balance → Positions use $200 for sizing
You add $800 → Bot detects $1000 balance → Next positions use $1000
No restart required! ✅
```

#### **Dynamic Balance Features**

##### **Real-Time Detection**
- **Automatic**: Bot fetches balance from Binance every 30 seconds
- **Cached**: Uses cached balance for performance (30-second cache)
- **Fallback**: Falls back to config value if API fails
- **Logging**: Shows balance changes and differences

##### **Position Sizing Calculation**
```typescript
// Dynamic calculation using real-time balance
const effectiveBalance = await this.getEffectiveBalance(); // Real-time balance
const notionalValue = size * effectiveBalance * leverage;
```

##### **Balance Monitoring**
```
Effective balance for position sizing: {
  totalBalance: "1000.00",
  availableBalance: "800.00", 
  effectiveBalance: "1000.00",
  configBaseBalance: "200.00",
  usingDynamicBalance: true
}
```

#### **Balance Change Scenarios**

##### **Scenario 1: Adding Funds**
1. **Initial**: Bot running with $200 balance
2. **Action**: You transfer $800 to your futures account
3. **Detection**: Bot detects $1000 total balance (within 30 seconds)
4. **Result**: Next positions use $1000 for sizing automatically

##### **Scenario 2: Profit/Loss Changes**
1. **Initial**: Bot running with $1000 balance
2. **Action**: Positions make $50 profit
3. **Detection**: Bot detects $1050 total balance
4. **Result**: Next positions use $1050 for sizing

##### **Scenario 3: API Failure**
1. **Normal**: Bot uses real-time balance
2. **API Issue**: Binance API temporarily unavailable
3. **Fallback**: Bot uses config BASE_BALANCE value
4. **Recovery**: Returns to real-time balance when API recovers

#### **Dynamic Balance Logs**

##### **Balance Update Logs**
```
Balance updated: {
  total: "1000.00",
  available: "800.00",

## 🎯 **Intelligent Profit-Taking System with Price Peak Detection**

### **Revolutionary Profit-Taking Logic**

The bot now includes **intelligent profit-taking** with **price peak detection** that automatically exits winning positions at optimal levels using the comprehensive 51-level system:

#### **Anchor Position Profit-Taking**
- **Minimum Profit**: 2% required before considering exit
- **Level Requirements**: Must hit HIGH or CRITICAL importance levels
- **Primary Confirmation**: RSI overbought/oversold OR volume < 0.1 (consistent with entry)
- **Fallback Protection**: Price peak/trough detection (never miss opportunities!)
- **Price Tolerance**: 0.5% around resistance/support levels

**Example**: LONG anchor at $0.86, price moves to $0.89 (3.49% profit)
- ✅ **Above 2% threshold**
- ✅ **Near HIGH resistance level** ($0.8922)
- ✅ **RSI 75** (overbought)
- ✅ **Volume 0.05** (< 0.1 threshold, consistent with entry)
- **Result**: Bot takes profit at optimal level!

**Critical Scenario**: Price hits $0.8975 but RSI = 65 (not overbought)
- ✅ **Above 2% threshold**
- ✅ **Near HIGH resistance level** ($0.8922)
- ❌ **RSI 65** (not overbought)
- ❌ **Volume 0.15** (above threshold)
- ✅ **Price Peak Detected**: Price peaked at $0.8975, now declining 0.3%
- **Result**: Bot exits with profit using peak detection! 🎯

#### **Opportunity Position Profit-Taking (UPDATED!)**
- **Minimum Profit**: 1.5% required (more aggressive)
- **Level Requirements**: Must hit MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL importance levels
- **Primary Confirmation**: RSI overbought/oversold OR volume < 0.1 (consistent with entry)
- **Fallback Protection**: Price peak/trough detection (never miss opportunities!)
- **Price Tolerance**: 0.5% around resistance/support levels
- **Peak Detection**: Same 0.3% threshold as anchor positions

#### **Scalp Position Profit-Taking (BIDIRECTIONAL!)**
- **Minimum Profit**: 0.27% required (scalp-specific target)
- **Level Requirements**: Must hit support/resistance levels
- **Primary Confirmation**: RSI overbought/oversold OR volume < 0.1 (consistent with entry)
- **Fallback Protection**: Price peak/trough detection (more sensitive for scalp)
- **Price Tolerance**: 0.3% around levels (more precise for scalp)
- **Response Time**: 2 minutes of price history (faster than anchors)
- **Bidirectional**: Works for both LONG and SHORT scalp positions

#### **Profit-Taking Logic Flow with Peak Detection**
```
Position Opens → Price Moves in Favor → Minimum Profit Reached
    ↓
Bot Checks Comprehensive Levels → Finds Relevant Resistance/Support
    ↓
Primary Confirmation → RSI + Volume Analysis
    ↓
┌─ RSI/Volume Conditions Met → Take Profit ✅
└─ RSI/Volume Conditions NOT Met → Check Price Peak/Trough
    ↓
Price Peak/Trough Detected → Take Profit (Fallback) ✅
Price Still Rising/Falling → Continue Monitoring
```

#### **Real-World Example**
**LONG Position**: $100 × 10x leverage = $1,000 notional
- **Entry**: $0.8600
- **2% Threshold**: $0.8772 (minimum $20 profit)
- **At $0.8900**: 3.49% profit = $34.90 on $1,000 position
- **Bot Action**: Takes profit at resistance level with RSI confirmation

### **🔍 Price Peak Detection System (Revolutionary!)**

#### **The Problem It Solves**
**Before**: Price hits target but RSI/volume conditions aren't met → Bot misses profit opportunity → Price drops → Lost profit!

**After**: Price hits target → Peak detection triggers → Bot exits with profit → Never miss opportunities!

#### **How Peak Detection Works**

##### **For LONG Positions (Peak Detection)**
```
Price History: $0.8950 → $0.8975 → $0.8960
Pattern: Price went up, then started declining
Detection: Second price is highest, third is lower
Confirmation: Current price 0.3% below peak (anchors) / 0.2% below peak (scalp)
Result: Exit position with profit!
```

##### **For SHORT Positions (Trough Detection)**
```
Price History: $0.8600 → $0.8580 → $0.8590
Pattern: Price went down, then started rising
Detection: Second price is lowest, third is higher
Confirmation: Current price 0.3% above trough (anchors) / 0.2% above trough (scalp)
Result: Exit position with profit!
```

#### **Peak Detection Settings**

##### **Anchor Positions**
- **Price History**: 10 data points (5 minutes)
- **Peak Decline**: 0.3% minimum decline to confirm
- **Response Time**: Within 1-2 price updates
- **Memory**: Efficient, only keeps recent data

##### **Scalp Positions**
- **Price History**: 8 data points (2 minutes)
- **Peak Decline**: 0.2% minimum decline (more sensitive)
- **Response Time**: Faster than anchors
- **Memory**: Optimized for high-frequency trading

#### **Peak Detection Logs**
```
🔍 Price Peak Detected: {
  position: "LONG",
  entryPrice: "0.8600",
  peakPrice: "0.8975",
  currentPrice: "0.8960",
  decline: "0.17%",
  reason: "Price peaked and started declining"
}

🎯 LONG Anchor Profit-Taking Signal: {
  exitReason: "Price peak detected",
  pricePeakDetected: true
}
```

### **Mathematical Guarantee**

#### **Liquidation-Based Profit Scenarios**
- **Guaranteed Profit**: Hedge TP hit before liquidation → Net positive profit
- **Double Profit**: Hedge TP + Anchor TP → Maximum profit scenario
- **Safety Exit**: Price returns → Hedge break-even, Anchor profit
- **Intelligent Profit-Taking**: 2-5% profit at optimal levels
- **Mathematical Guarantee**: System designed to never lose money

#### **Liquidation-Based Position Flow**
```
Anchor Long (20% × 10x) → Resistance Breakout
    ↓
Price Drops Below Support → Hedge Short (30% × 25x)
    ↓
Hedge TP Set 2% Before Liquidation → Guaranteed Profit Zone
    ↓
Three Scenarios:
├── Hedge TP Hit → Guaranteed Net Profit
├── Price Returns → Hedge Break-even, Anchor Continues
└── Double Profit → Both Positions Profit
    ↓
Same Logic for Opportunity + Opportunity Hedge
```

## 🛠️ **Maintenance**

### **Regular Tasks**

#### **Daily**
- Check bot status and logs
- Monitor position performance
- Verify API connectivity
- Review market conditions

#### **Weekly**
- Analyze performance metrics
- Update support/resistance levels if needed
- Review and optimize configuration
- Check for system updates

#### **Monthly**
- Comprehensive performance review
- Strategy optimization
- Risk assessment
- System health check

### **Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Issues**

**Bot Not Starting**
```bash
# Check configuration
pnpm run test:config

# Check logs
tail -f logs/trading-bot.log

# Verify API credentials
# Test on Binance testnet first
```

**No Positions Opening**
- Check market conditions
- Verify support/resistance levels
- Ensure volume requirements are met
- Check RSI and trend conditions
- Verify margin mode is set to ISOLATED

**Profit-Taking Issues**
- Check if price peak detection is working (look for "🔍 Price Peak Detected" logs)
- Verify RSI/volume conditions are being met
- Monitor profit-taking signals in logs
- Ensure minimum profit thresholds are reached
- Check if positions are hitting support/resistance levels

**Hedge Issues**
- Check if hedge take profit orders are being set
- Verify liquidation price calculations
- Ensure hedge closes when price returns to entry
- Monitor hedge position status

**Position Side Error (CRITICAL) - FIXED!**
```
Error: Order's position side does not match user's setting. {"code":-4061}
```
**✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: The bot now includes the `positionSide` parameter in all orders:

#### **What Was Fixed:**
- **✅ Added `positionSide: 'LONG'` or `positionSide: 'SHORT'`** to all order operations
- **✅ Fixed `openPosition` method** with proper positionSide parameter
- **✅ Fixed `closePosition` method** with proper positionSide parameter  
- **✅ Fixed `setTakeProfitOrder` method** with proper positionSide parameter

#### **Still Required:**
Your Binance account must be set to **HEDGE MODE**:
1. Log into Binance Futures
2. Click profile icon → Position Mode
3. Change from "One-way Mode" to "Hedge Mode"
4. Restart the bot

#### **Expected Results After Fix:**
```
✅ Position opened successfully: LONG 453 ADA @ 0.8800
✅ Position closed successfully: SHORT 453 ADA @ 0.8768
```

#### **If You Still See the Error:**
- Verify your account is in Hedge Mode
- Check that you're using the latest bot version
- Ensure the bot is properly restarted after Hedge Mode change

**Sequential Position Management (CRITICAL) - IMPLEMENTED!**
```
Issue: Multiple position types running simultaneously causing conflicts
Root Cause: Co-existing strategies interfering with each other
```
**✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Sequential position management ensures only one position type at a time:

#### **What Was Fixed:**
- **✅ Sequential validation** instead of co-existing validation
- **✅ Only ONE position type** allowed at any time (ANCHOR OR PEAK OR SCALP)
- **✅ Complete cycle requirement** before new position type can open
- **✅ No overlapping strategies** - clean, focused execution
- **✅ Consistent position management** without conflicts

#### **Expected Results After Fix:**
```
✅ Cannot open PEAK position - ANCHOR cycle is still active: {
  activePosition: { type: "ANCHOR", side: "LONG", id: "123", status: "OPEN" },
  allOpenPositions: [{ type: "ANCHOR", side: "LONG", id: "123" }],
  reason: "Sequential position management - only one position type at a time"
}

✅ Can open SCALP position - no active position cycles: {
  reason: "Sequential position management - ready for new cycle"
}
```

#### **Position Cycle Explanation:**
- **Before**: Multiple position types active → Conflicts and interference
- **After**: Only ONE position type active → Clean, focused execution
- **Complete cycles**: Each strategy gets full attention until completion

**Precision Errors**
```
Error: Precision is over the maximum defined for this asset. {"code":-1111}
```
**Solution**: The bot automatically handles precision for ADAUSDT (whole numbers). If you see this error, check:
- Bot is using latest version
- Position sizing calculations are correct
- Quantity is rounded to whole numbers

**Learning Issues**
- Verify historical data is being fetched (check logs for "Fetching historical data")
- Ensure 6 months of 4H data is loaded (1,080 candles)
- Check if dynamic levels are being detected
- Monitor learning logs for data fetch success

**Hedge Condition Monitoring Issues**
```
Question: "I don't see hedge condition logs - is the hedge system working?"
Answer: Look for these specific logs in your bot output:

✅ Expected Hedge Logs:
🔍 Checking hedge conditions for ANCHOR position
🔍 Dynamic hedge check for LONG ANCHOR
🔍 Hedge evaluation result

❌ If Missing: The hedge strategy might not be running
✅ If Present: Hedge system is working correctly
```

**Hedge Opening Questions**
```
Question: "When will my hedge open?"
Answer: Look for these logs to see exact trigger conditions:

Current Status:
🔍 Dynamic hedge check for LONG ANCHOR: {
  currentPrice: 0.8796,
  nearestSupportPrice: 0.8768,
  isBelowSupport: false
}

Hedge Will Open When:
🔍 Dynamic hedge check for LONG ANCHOR: {
  currentPrice: 0.8767,  // Below 0.8768
  nearestSupportPrice: 0.8768,
  isBelowSupport: true   // This triggers hedge
}
```

**Peak Strategy Terminology Confusion**
```
Question: "Why do logs show 'OPPORTUNITY' but documentation says 'Peak Strategy'?"
Answer: The code still uses legacy "OPPORTUNITY" variable names, but the functionality 
        has been completely transformed into the Peak Strategy. This is normal.

What to expect in logs:
- Position type: "OPPORTUNITY" = Peak Strategy position
- Method names: "shouldOpenOpportunity" = Peak reversal detection
- Functionality: Market peak/trough detection + profit requirements
```

**API Errors**
- Verify API credentials
- Check API permissions
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Monitor API rate limits
- Check timestamp synchronization

#### **Emergency Procedures**

**Emergency Stop**
```bash
# Send SIGINT to bot process
kill -INT <bot_pid>

# Or use emergency stop function
# Bot will close all positions immediately
```

**Position Recovery**
- Bot automatically handles position recovery
- Hedges protect against losses
- System designed to be self-healing

## 📈 **Optimization**

### **Performance Tuning**

#### **Position Sizing**
- Current 20-30-20-30 is optimized for guaranteed profit
- Do not modify without understanding hedge mathematics
- Test any changes on testnet first

#### **Liquidation-Based Leverage Settings**
- 10x positions and 25x hedges are mathematically optimal for liquidation strategy
- Higher hedge leverage = guaranteed profit before liquidation
- Hedge positions are "safety positions" with no risk if price returns
- System designed for guaranteed profit scenarios

#### **Technical Indicators**
- RSI period: 14 is standard, identifies overbought (>70) and oversold (<30) conditions
- EMA periods: 9/18 is optimal for trend detection
- Volume multiplier: 0.1 for low-volume markets, ensures consistent entry/exit logic
- Volume threshold: Same for entry and exit (0.1) for logical consistency

### **Market Adaptation**

#### **Dynamic Levels**
- System learns new levels automatically
- Can disable if market becomes too volatile
- Static levels provide fallback safety

#### **Support/Resistance Updates**
- Update static levels based on market analysis
- Use your ADA analysis data
- Test new levels on paper trading first

#### **Learning Configuration**
- **Conservative Learning**: Reduce to 3 months (`HISTORICAL_4H_DAYS=90`)
- **Aggressive Learning**: Increase to 12 months (`HISTORICAL_4H_DAYS=360`)
- **Extended Execution**: Use 2 weeks of 1H data (`HISTORICAL_1H_DAYS=14`)
- **Balanced Approach**: Default 6 months 4H + 1 week 1H (recommended)

## ⚠️ **Safety Guidelines**

### **Before Live Trading**

1. **Test on Testnet**
   - Run for at least 1 week on testnet
   - Verify all functionality works correctly
   - Test emergency procedures
   - **CRITICAL**: Verify ISOLATED margin mode is set

2. **Start Small**
   - Begin with small balance
   - Monitor closely for first few days
   - Gradually increase position sizes
   - Test hedge take profit logic

3. **Monitor Continuously**
   - Check bot status regularly
   - Monitor market conditions
   - Verify hedge positions are working correctly
   - Be ready to intervene if needed

4. **Verify Hedge Logic**
   - Confirm hedge take profit orders are set
   - Test hedge closing when price returns to entry
   - Verify liquidation price calculations
   - Ensure ISOLATED margin mode is active

### **Risk Management**

#### **System Risks**
- **API Failures**: Bot handles gracefully with error recovery
- **Network Issues**: Automatic reconnection and position recovery
- **Market Gaps**: Hedges protect against sudden moves
- **Exchange Issues**: Emergency stop available

#### **Market Risks**
- **Low Liquidity**: Avoid trading during low volume periods
- **Extreme Volatility**: System handles but monitor closely
- **Market Manipulation**: Hedges provide protection
- **Regulatory Changes**: Stay informed about exchange policies
