Futures crypto strategy: 
- Bot studies a given crypto asset like ADA.
- Identifies support and resistance areas. 
- Upon signal, bot places order.
- Position open using 40% of balance: If price moves as predected > win.
- If price moves against predicted and show opposite movement signs > bot opens hedge order opposite to the current position.
- Hedge position using 60% of balance.
- Hedge order opens if price passes first position's stop loss zone.
- If first position is liquidated, bot closes second position. 
- If price return to original direction (against hedge), this hedge position is closed when it is back to its open price. 
- If price satisfies first position direction > win. 
- If price returns agains first position > a new hedge is open similar to the first hedge scenario.
- This way initial orders either win or do not lose.
